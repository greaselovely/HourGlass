# HourGlass - Multi-Project Webcam Timelapse System

## Overview
HourGlass is a flexible and robust webcam timelapse system that automatically downloads images from any webcam URL, generates time-lapse videos from these images, and optionally adds soundtracks. The system supports multiple concurrent projects, features enhanced reliability, performance monitoring, and intelligent error handling. It runs continuously, capturing images at configurable intervals, with advanced session recovery and exponential backoff for maximum uptime.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Multi-Project Support:** Manage multiple timelapse projects from a single installation
- **Automated Image Downloads:** Downloads images from any configured webcam URL
- **MJPEG Stream Support:** Extracts frames from MJPEG video streams
- **Duplicate Avoidance:** Uses SHA-256 hashing to prevent saving duplicate images
- **Time-Lapse Video Creation:** Generates high-quality time-lapse videos from collected images
- **Audio Track Addition:** Adds dynamic soundtracks to time-lapse videos using Pixabay

### Enhanced Capabilities
- **Robust Error Handling:** Exponential backoff and automatic session recovery
- **Health Monitoring:** Real-time system monitoring with alerts for disk space, memory, CPU, and network
- **Fast Image Validation:** 5-10x faster image processing using optimized validation
- **Memory Management:** Prevents out-of-memory crashes with intelligent cleanup and chunked processing
- **Performance Metrics:** Comprehensive logging and performance tracking
- **Log Rotation:** Automatic log file management preventing huge log files
- **Configuration Validation:** Startup validation of settings and system health
- **Timezone Support:** Automatic timezone handling for remote webcams
- **tmux Integration:** Run captures in background with easy monitoring

## Tested On
- **Ubuntu**
- **Fedora** 
- **Debian**
- **macOS**

## Requirements
- Python 3.12 (specifically - newer versions may have compatibility issues with dependencies)
- tmux (for background operation)
- Additional system monitoring capabilities (automatically installed)

## Quick Start

### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
bash setup.sh

# Configure your first project
python timelapse_setup.py
```

### 2. Running a Project
```bash
# Start capture for a project
./hourglass.sh <project_name>

# Or run directly with Python
python main.py <project_name>

# Run with time bypass (for testing)
python main.py <project_name> --no-time-check
```

### 3. Create Video Only
```bash
# Generate video from existing images
python main.py <project_name> --movie
```

## Project Structure

Projects are stored in the `configs/` directory:
```
HourGlass/
├── configs/
│   ├── project1.json
│   ├── project2.json
│   └── ...
├── instructions/
│   ├── project1_instructions.txt
│   └── ...
└── <project_base>/
    ├── images/
    ├── video/
    ├── audio/
    └── logging/
```

## Configuration

Each project has its own configuration file in `configs/<project_name>.json`. Key settings include:

- **Webcam URLs:** Direct image URL or MJPEG stream
- **Capture interval:** Time between image captures
- **Sunrise/sunset times:** Automatic or manual scheduling
- **Timezone offset:** For remote webcam locations
- **Alert settings:** ntfy.sh integration for notifications
- **Audio settings:** Background music configuration

## Managing Multiple Projects

### List Projects
```bash
ls configs/
```

### Create New Project
```bash
python timelapse_setup.py
# Select "Create new project"
```

### Update Existing Project
```bash
python timelapse_setup.py
# Select the project to update
```

## tmux Session Management

HourGlass automatically creates tmux sessions for background operation:

```bash
# Attach to running session
tmux attach -t hourglass-<project_name>

# List all sessions
tmux list-sessions

# Kill a session
tmux kill-session -t hourglass-<project_name>
```

## Cron Scheduling

Each project's instructions file contains customized cron entries. Example:

```bash
# Start capture at sunrise
0 6 * * * cd /path/to/HourGlass && ./hourglass.sh project_name

# Stop capture after sunset
0 20 * * * pkill -f 'python main.py project_name'
```

## Advanced Features

### Health Monitoring
```bash
python main.py <project_name> --health
```

### Configuration Validation
```bash
python main.py <project_name> --validate
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
python main.py <project_name> --debug
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No project found:** Ensure the project config exists in `configs/`
2. **Session creation failed:** Check USER_AGENTS and PROXIES in config
3. **Images not saving:** Verify the webcam URL is accessible
4. **MJPEG streams:** The system automatically detects and handles MJPEG streams

### Logs

Check project-specific logs:
```bash
tail -f ~/HourGlass/<project_name>/logging/timelapse.log
```

## Performance Notes

- Optimized for long-running captures with automatic recovery
- Memory-efficient processing for large image collections
- Automatic cleanup of temporary files
- Intelligent backoff for network failures
