# VLA
Very Large Array Image Download Scripts

# Why?

So I decided that while I was sitting idle at work that I'd script the download of the image from the VLA webcam.  And I started with PowerShell since it was what I had immediate access to.

Once that was done, I decided to port it over to Python.  Once I did that, I found myself wanting to make it as close as I could to the PowerShell script.

Once I was done with massaging both of those, I decided, yeah, Bash.  So I wrote the shell script.

What I think is fascinating to see is comparing them all side by side, and even if they are simple and trivial, it gives good insight on how the syntax is between them.  I think it's worth at least checking out even for a brief moment.

Have a beautiful day.
